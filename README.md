# AlternativeProgramming


Which programming language and version did you pick?

I choose Kotlin programming language and 1.9.23

Why did you pick this programming language?

I choose this programming because it is similar to java and I find it more interesting.

How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, 
conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods),
unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming 
language, indicate it as so.

List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and
explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.

The libraries that were used are :

java.io.File: For reading the CSV file

java.util.regex.Pattern : It is used for regular expression matching and data cleaning.
